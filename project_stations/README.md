How to run:

    You should be fine after install 2 libraries which are 
    -The Fuzz:
    pip install thefuzz

    -Tkinter:
    pip install tk


    After installing these libraries simply run the code and you will be able to use the interface as well.
    
Functionalities:
    task1_1 :
        This code allows user to find the station's abbrevations or the full names based on the input.
    task1_2 :
        This code has the same functionality with the first one but it is more open to mistakes such as wrong input from the user.
    task1_3 :
        This code is about the implementation of multiprocessing with some extra functinalities.
    

Additional note:
    Since the project is not completed yet, I have not sticked with the template of a proper read.me.
